AI Job Suggestion System: Java + Python Integration
This project is designed to allow users to input their qualifications, skills, and other details, then generates job recommendations using a Python-based AI script. The system is built with Java for the user interface and Python for processing the AI-based insights.

Features
Java GUI: Allows users to input personal details, including qualifications and skills.

Python Script: Processes input using AI to generate job recommendations based on the user's profile.

Integration: Java application runs the Python script and displays results to the user.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Java: Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download it from here.

Python: Install Python 3.x from here. Ensure you also install the required libraries.

Python Libraries: Make sure you have the required libraries for the Python script.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests
Google Custom Search API: Set up a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) here and get your API key. Insert your API Key and CSE ID into the appropriate places in the code.

How to Run the Java Application
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
Open the Java project in your preferred IDE (like Eclipse).

Update the paths in the Java code:

Update inputFilePath to where the user input text file is saved.

Update outputFilePath to where the job recommendation output will be saved.

Make sure that the Python script's path is correctly specified.

Run the Java application:

This will open the GUI where you can input your personal details.

Once the input is provided, it will execute the Python script to generate job recommendations and display them to the user.

How to Run the Python Script Independently
Set up Python:

Install Python and the required libraries if you haven't already.

Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python ai_insight.py
Provide user input:

Create a text file with the user details (skills, qualifications, etc.) in the format expected by the script. The Python script will read this input file, process it, and output job recommendations to another text file.

How it Works
Step 1: The user inputs their personal details (skills, qualifications, etc.) through the Java GUI.

Step 2: The Java application writes the input to a file.

Step 3: The Java application triggers the Python script, which processes the input and uses Google Custom Search to find relevant job recommendations.

Step 4: The results are saved in an output file and displayed to the user.

Known Issues
Spaces in File Names: If you experience issues with file paths due to spaces, ensure that paths are properly quoted or, preferably, avoid spaces in filenames.

API Rate Limiting: Google Custom Search has rate limits. Ensure you’re not exceeding these limits while testing.
